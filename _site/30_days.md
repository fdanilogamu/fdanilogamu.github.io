# Introduction

I've always dreamed of being at a company that allows me autonomy when working from day one. If you're wondering what that looks like, this is it: 

# Week 1: Hit the Ground Running

- Audit existing workflows and ops tools (I find pain points, and fast)
- Get a feel for team dynamics, priorities, gaps in communication, and needs in the software stack. (Perhaps some things you've been accepting as realities, are opportunities for change)
- Set up personal tracking to manage and report on tasks. (My own spreadsheet or Monday board just for paying attention to these things)

# Week 2: Let there be Order

- Implement immediate low-effort wins (those small things that we can celebrate early and provide momentum.)
- Build or refine a basic internal documentation structure (are you still using Google Docs for everything internal? Let's upgrade.)
- Start building toward deeper long-term solutions by forging rapport with key stakeholders, and sharing plans with them.

# Week 3-4: Deliver and Elevate

- Ship key documents or restructure existing ones with better flow and clarity.
- Propose and test a lightweight ops system or guideline for improving communication and/or task hand-off. 
- Identify at least one process which can be simplified or automated.
