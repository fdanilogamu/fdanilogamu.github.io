      <div class="testimonial">
        <blockquote>
          "My name is John Hidalgo. I met Dani maybe three years ago, in the time
that I have known him, I have found him to be a great and responsible
person and he fulfills his obligations as requested. I was fortunate
to meet him as a coworker and English teacher, In my opinion he helped
me a lot to improve my English level, he has many methods and very
agile dynamics to learn; on the other hand in the professional side,
I could see the products as a result of his work and I think they
are of excellent quality, for this and more reasons I recommend his
work to anyone who wants to contact him for his good relevance and
management."
