      <h1>Hi, call me Fletcher.</h1>
      <p>I build systems, and solve problems.</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I’ve led documentation rebuilds, supported C-level execs, written for users and developers, and kept fast-moving teams on track. <br> My background is in technical writing, operations, and project coordination, but what I really do is look at a messy situation and say, “Alright. Let’s make this work.”</p>

        <h2>What I’ve Built</h2>

          <li><strong>Traze Knowledge Base:</strong> 250+ articles built from scratch, still used by internal and external users.</li>
          <li><strong>Heavy Blankie:</strong> Refillable, collapsible travel-friendly weighted blanket. Multiple prototypes made.</li>

        <h2>Ideas I Can’t Stop Thinking About</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SWIPET:</strong> A dating-style app that matches shelter pets with potential adopters.</li>
          <li><strong>The Backwards Chair:</strong> A chair for dentists and tattoo artists with chest support instead of a backrest.</li>
          <li><strong>The Shrecycler:</strong> A shredder that recycles paper into rolls.</li>
         </ul>
        <p><em>I’m an idea machine; if one gets taken, I just make more. Go ahead and take one of my ideas, just let me know so we can bask in the fact that it now exists in the world.</em></p>
