      <p>I build systems and solve problems.</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I’ve led documentation rebuilds, supported C-level execs, written for users and developers, and kept fast-moving teams on track. <br> My background is in technical writing, operations, and project coordination, but what I love to do is look at a messy situation and say, “Alright. Let’s see how we can make this work.”</p>

          <li><strong>Traze Knowledge Base:</strong> 250+ articles built from scratch, still used by internal and external users.</li>
          <li><strong>Heavy Blankie:</strong> Refillable, collapsible travel-friendly weighted blanket. Multiple prototypes made.</li>

        <h2>Ideas that Keep me up at Night</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SWIPET:</strong> A dating-style app that matches shelter pets with potential adopters.</li>
          <li><strong>The Backwards Chair:</strong> A chair for dentists and tattoo artists with chest support instead of a backrest.</li>
          <li><strong>The Shrecycler:</strong> A shredder that recycles paper into rolls.</li>
         </ul>
        <p><em>I’m an idea machine; if one gets taken, I just make more. You can go ahead and take one of my ideas, just let me know so we can bask in the fact that it now exists in the world.</em></p>
