      <h1>Hi, I’m Fletcher.</h1>
      <p>I build systems, solve problems, and bring ideas to life.</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I’ve led documentation rebuilds, supported C-level execs, written for users and developers, and kept fast-moving teams on track. My background is in technical writing, operations, and project coordination, but what I really do is look at a messy situation and say, “Alright. Let’s make this work.”</p>

        <h2>What I’ve Built</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Superna Documentation Rebuild:</strong> 100+ articles, standardized format, process design, team mentoring.</li>
          <li><strong>Traze Knowledge Base:</strong> 250+ articles built from scratch, still used by internal and external users.</li>
          <li><strong>Heavy Blankie:</strong> Refillable, collapsible travel-friendly weighted blanket. Multiple prototypes made.</li>
          <li><strong>Personal ops systems:</strong> Built in Monday.com, Notion, and Markdown. Always evolving. Always effective.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Ideas I Can’t Stop Thinking About</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SWIPET:</strong> A dating-style app that matches shelter pets with potential adopters.</li>
          <li><strong>The Backwards Chair:</strong> A chair for dentists and tattoo artists with chest support instead of a backrest.</li>
          <li><strong>The Shrecycler:</strong> A shredder that recycles paper into rolls.</li>
          <li><strong>The Heavy Blankie:</strong> A traveler’s weighted blanket that folds down to t-shirt size and can be filled with anything (even beans).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>I’m an idea machine. If one gets taken, I just make more.</em></p>

      <section>
        <h2>What I’m Looking For</h2>
        <p>I want to be part of a team that gets it — one where I can contribute ideas, systems, clarity, and good work. If you think I might be a fit, reach out. Or steal one of my ideas and build it. I won't stop you.</p>
