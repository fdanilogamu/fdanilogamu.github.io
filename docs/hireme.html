<h1>Hire Me as Director of Operations</h1>

<p>I help founders and execs turn that dreaded “we should get organized” conversation, into an actual operational system that people use. Not just a pretty dashboard no one opens, but rather a working system you'll want to see.</p>

<h2>What I’m looking for</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Remote-only.</li>
  <li>Autonomy expected — task / outcome-based follow-up, not hourly.</li>
  <li>Direct access to the CEO / founder.</li>
  <li>Minimum compensation: <strong>$4,000 USD / month</strong>.</li>
  <li>Industry: SaaS is ideal, but I’ve also run ops for service/event businesses. If there’s a black box to open, I’m in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I actually want to do every day</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Run the work in a PM tool</strong> (Jira, ClickUp, Monday, whatever you use) and make it the single source of truth.</li>
  <li><strong>Move data forward</strong> — reports, Excel/Sheets, ops metrics, “are we actually doing what we said?”</li>
  <li><strong>Talk to the CEO</strong> to translate ideas → projects → owners → timelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the role is mostly “wait for tasks and look busy,” it’s not for me.</p>

<h2>How I work</h2>
<p>I work in <strong>extremely optimized bursts of organization</strong>. I don’t do 8 hours of fake productivity. I go in, untangle, define the system, and people can actually use it.</p>
<p>My job is to name things, centralize work, and make decisions easier.</p>

<h2>What you get if you hire me</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A system that isn’t just for decoration.</strong> We use it and it works.</li>
  <li><strong>A real ops layer</strong> between you (vision) and the team (execution).</li>
  <li><strong>Cleaner communication:</strong> who’s doing what, by when, and how we’ll know it was done.</li>
  <li><strong>Faster CEO brain-to-team translation.</strong> You talk, I turn it into work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I need from you</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Trust.</strong> If you need to micromanage, don’t hire me.</li>
  <li><strong>Access.</strong> I can’t fix ops if I don’t see the real problems.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency.</strong> If we agree Jira (or whatever) is the source of truth, we use Jira.</li>
</ul>

<h2>30-day way of working (example)</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Day 1–5:</strong> audit current ops: tools, docs, where work actually happens (not where you say it happens).</li>
  <li><strong>Day 5–10:</strong> define the core workflow (requests → approval → execution → reporting).</li>
  <li><strong>Day 10–20:</strong> build it inside your PM tool, create views for CEO vs. team.</li>
  <li><strong>Day 20–30:</strong> tighten accountability with weekly ops review, KPI snapshot, backlog grooming.</li>
</ol>
<p>After that, we iterate. I like short feedback loops.</p>

<h2>Not a fit if…</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You want to approve every single task.</li>
  <li>You don’t want to show me your messy back office.</li>
  <li>You just want “documentation” without changing behavior.</li>
  <li>You want hourly reporting instead of outcome reporting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why me</h2>
<p>I’ve done this in events, in tech-adjacent environments, and around founders with 100 ideas a week. I know how to translate them into structured work without killing their creativity.</p>
