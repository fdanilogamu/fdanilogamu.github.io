## What's this all about?
<br>
<br>

Interviews and CVs can only go so far when it comes to understanding who someone really is in a professional context.

You’re often left with a few bullet points, which isn’t enough to assess learning curve, adaptability, or how a person actually thinks through problems.

<br>

This portfolio is my way of closing that gap.

<br>

Here, you’ll find details on every role I’ve held:

<br>

- How I grew in each company

- The types of projects I executed

- The makeup of my team (when applicable)

- Challenges I overcame

- Feedback and recognition

- What I took away from each experience

<br>

For now, let me start by giving you some context:

<br>

I have a background in Production Engineering, with formal training in lean methodologies, process improvement, and automation. I’ve been working in operations and project management for over seven years, primarily in the SaaS space. I've led teams, improved systems, and helped things run smoother from the inside.

I’m fluent in tools like JIRA, Notion, Monday.com, ClickUp, and more. To me, learning new software is like riding a bike, just a different color each time.

If you're trying to figure out whether I'm a good fit, this is the clearest window into how I work.
