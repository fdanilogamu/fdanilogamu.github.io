## What's this all about?
<br>
<br>

Interviews and CVs can only go so far when it comes to truly figuring out who a person is in the professional world. 
You usually have very little time (and frankly, information) to deduce how they behave, what their average learning curve looks like, and ultimately, 
what value they can potentially bring to your company.
<br>
<br>
This is an approach to achieving just that, for you: the person who is considering me as a possible future asset.
<br>
<br>
What must first be taken into account when getting to know me as a professional, 
is that although I have sixteen years of work experience, I’ve worked in more 
than five different industries, and types of roles.
<br>
<br>
Throughout this portfolio, you will find details about each role I’ve held:
<br>
<br>

-   How I grew in each company.
    
-   What types of projects I executed.
    
-   The makeup of my team, if applicable.
    
-   Challenges overcome    

-   Feedback and recognition    

-   What I took away with me as a learned lesson, applicable from then on.
