# TWL

## Role(s)
**Positions:** Project Manager / Internal Control Manager  
<br>

## How did this Role help me as an Ops Wizard?
This was the job that taught me how to run operations at scale.  
TWL had many different teams working at the same time on very different projects.  
I was the person keeping everything aligned and moving in the same direction.

I worked directly with the CEO and CFO and handled more responsibility here than in any other role.  
<br>

## Industry
**Industry:** Adult Entertainment Administration (services)  
<br>

## Projects
### Multi-Project Management
- **Description:** Coordinated 13 active projects across marketing, design, development, VR, and charity work.
- **My role:** Organized work, set priorities, removed roadblocks, and kept all teams moving with clarity.
- **Outcome:** Projects started to run on a steady rhythm instead of constant chaos.

## Growth
I was promoted four times in two years.  
This happened because I consistently took ownership and solved problems without waiting for direction.  
<br>

## Team
I supervised and coordinated the work of more than 50 people across multiple teams.  
I kept communication open, honest, and simple so everyone understood what needed to be done.  
<br>

## Challenges
The environment moved fast and changed often.  
I had to make quick decisions, stay calm under pressure, and manage several responsibilities at the same time.  
This is where I learned how to stay grounded while everything around me sped up.  
<br>

## Type of Work

<br>

## Impact on the Company
Because of the structure and clarity I introduced, the company became easier to run.  
Processes improved, teams followed clear expectations, and leadership could finally see what was happening across all projects.  
<br>

## Feedback / Recognition
I was consistently recognized for my work and trusted with more responsibility over time.  
My promotions reflected the impact I had on operations and team coordination.  
<br>

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to:
- Guide many teams without micromanaging them  
- Create clarity in a fast-moving work environment

- Keep work simple and steady even when everything gets loud  

This role shaped how I approach operations today.
