# Introduction

I've always dreamed of being at a company that allows me autonomy when working from day one. This is important to me because working with clipped wings is possible, but entirely different and less fruitful. 

If you're wondering what my autonomy looks like, this is it: 

# Phase 1: Hit the Ground Running

- Audit existing workflows and ops tools (I find pain points, fast)
- Get a feel for team dynamics, priorities, gaps in communication, and needs in the software stack. (Perhaps some things you've been accepting as realities, are opportunities for change)
- Set up personal tracking to manage and report on tasks. (My own spreadsheet or Monday board just for paying attention to these things)

# Phase 2: Let there be Order

- Jump on immediate low-effort wins (those small things that we can celebrate early and provide momentum.)
- Build or refine a basic internal documentation structure (are you still using Google Docs for everything internal? Let's upgrade.)
- Start building toward deeper long-term solutions by forging rapport with key stakeholders, and sharing plans with them.

# Phase 3-4: Deliver and Elevate

- Ship key documents or restructure existing ones with better flow and clarity.
- Propose and test a lightweight ops system or guideline for improving communication and/or task hand-off. 
- Identify at least one process which can be simplified or automated.
