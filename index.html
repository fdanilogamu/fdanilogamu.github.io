      <h2>About this Page</h2>
      <p>I'm going to be playing around with this page through different means,<br> and populating it with information about my professional portfolio.<br><br>Feel free to navigate whatever is available!
<br>
The intention is to create a Soft Skill Portfolio, in a way, to lend a more detailed window into my experience
<br>
and how it all contributed to my talent as a professional.
<br>
I will also be including work samples once the site takes better shape.</p>
