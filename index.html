        <h2>Where I Create Impact</h2>

        <ul class="impact-list">
          Cut onboarding time by ~45% by redesigning workflows, consolidating information, and removing redundant steps. <br>

          Expanded internal knowledge from 0% to ~85% coverage, enabling faster ramp-up and more consistent cross-team execution. <br>

          Directed operations across 13 simultaneous projects, coordinating work for 52 contributors with clear expectations and deadlines. <br>

          Built operational dashboards and reporting systems that increased transparency, reduced confusion, and allowed leadership to make decisions faster. <br>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>
          I design and implement the operations growing companies depend on:
          workflow architecture, documentation systems, <br> cross-team alignment, and
          the execution structure that lets founders focus on strategy.
