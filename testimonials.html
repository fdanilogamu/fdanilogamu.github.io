          "I had the pleasure of working with Fletcher recently, in the context of a documentation revamp project for a software company. Their leadership skills and attention to detail was immediately apparent. I was very impressed with how quickly they prepared a realistic plan and timeline to a deliverable. They will be an asset to any project that requires a cool head and the ability to make sense of the chaos, keeping an eye on the big picture."

        <blockquote>
         I had the great pleasure of working with Fletcher at Idiomas EAFIT, where he proved to be an excellent English teacher. As a native speaker, language was never a barrier for him, but what truly set him apart was his sharp critical thinking and ability to listen attentively. Fletcher is one of those team members who brings intelligence, insight, and thoughtful engagement to every discussion. His analytical mindset and strong communication skills made him a valuable colleague, both in the classroom and within the team. Any organization would be fortunate to have him on board.

          "I met Fletcher maybe three years ago, in the time
that I have known him, I have found him to be a great and responsible
person and he fulfills his obligations as requested. I was fortunate
to meet him as a coworker and English teacher, In my opinion he helped
me a lot to improve my English level, he has many methods and very
agile dynamics to learn; on the other hand in the professional side,
I could see the products as a result of his work and I think they
are of excellent quality, for this and more reasons I recommend his
work to anyone who wants to contact him for his good relevance and
management."
