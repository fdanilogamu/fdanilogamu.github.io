          "I had the great pleasure of working with Fletcher recently, in the context of a documentation revamp project for a software company. Their leadership skills and attention to detail was immediately apparent. I was very impressed with how quickly they prepared a realistic plan and timeline to a deliverable. They will be an asset to any project that requires a cool head and the ability to make sense of the chaos, keeping an eye on the big picture."

        <blockquote>
         I had the pleasure of working with Fletcher at Idiomas EAFIT, where he proved to be an excellent English teacher. As a native speaker, language was never a barrier for him, but what truly set him apart was his sharp critical thinking and ability to listen attentively. Fletcher is one of those team members who brings intelligence, insight, and thoughtful engagement to every discussion. His analytical mindset and strong communication skills made him a valuable colleague, both in the classroom and within the team. Any organization would be fortunate to have him on board.

          "I met Fletcher maybe three years ago, in the time
that I have known him, I have found him to be a great and responsible
person and he fulfills his obligations as requested. I was fortunate
to meet him as a coworker and English teacher, In my opinion he helped
me a lot to improve my English level, he has many methods and very
agile dynamics to learn; on the other hand in the professional side,
I could see the products as a result of his work and I think they
are of excellent quality, for this and more reasons I recommend his
work to anyone who wants to contact him for his good relevance and
management."

        <blockquote>
          "I had the pleasure of working with Fletch on a 6 month contract that extended for well over a year.
          One of Fletch’s standout qualities is his agility—both in mindset and execution. Whether navigating sudden shifts in project scope or responding to unexpected operational challenges,
          he remained composed and solution-oriented. 
          His ability to assess evolving priorities and act decisively made him a trusted point person in high-pressure situations. 
          I’ve personally observed him navigate sensitive conversations and cross-departmental
          negotiations with a calm confidence that earned respect from both peers and leadership. This
          tact was particularly valuable when aligning conflicting interests between internal teams or
          working with external partners.
          In terms of organization, Fletch is amazing! He maintained clear, methodical processes and
          often implemented systems that improved our team's overall efficiency. His attention to
          detail—combined with the ability to keep broader strategic goals in focus—made him an
          indispensable part of the team.
          A unique and invaluable strength of Fletch’s is his ability to act as a liaison between technical
          and non-technical audiences. He possesses a rare talent for translating complex technical
          concepts into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders at all levels. This skill not only
          accelerated project timelines but also fostered better understanding and collaboration across
          departments.
          I am confident that Fletch will be a tremendous asset to any organization. His blend of
          operational expertise, interpersonal finesse, and strategic thinking make him uniquely
          well-suited for an operations role. I strongly recommend him for this position and am happy to
          provide further insight if needed."

          "I have had the good fortune to know Fletcher for more than three years, and I can say that he is an incredibly self-managed man. We lived together for a period of time, and I was able to observe how he always manages to optimize his tasks to the max, finding methods and techniques to do everything more efficiently and effectively. His time management is admirable, and he constantly enhances his knowledge through study techniques that he applies with great efficiency."
